## :dart: Requirements achieved

- [x] Used semantic tags: header, nav and footer
- [x] Implemented CSS absolute positioning to overlay text on an image - using repeated CSS to reduce code
- [x] Utilised Flexbox to create a responsive layout. I am particularly happy with using **font-size: vw** to make text size reponsive to the viewport window
- [x] I am so pleased that I learned how to copy files from my Windows system into the Ubuntu - I had been searching the web for a whole day! Images were cp'ed into the Ubuntu project folder and pushed to github, so are stable for the site. Images are also responsive. :blush:

## :dart: Stretch goals

- [x] Back to top button is a Font-Awesome icon using an anchor tag at the top of the page :smiley:
- [x] I learned how to implement smooth scrolling using CSS **scroll-behavior: smooth** :relaxed:
- [x] I loved using pseudo tags to change the a:hover effects, though I used a minimal style to suit this website :smirk:
- [x] For the footer social media icons, I used the Font-Awesome icons :wink:
- [x] Added dark mode - I wanted to add some JavaScript. I followed the steps from the demo to change the document.body, I then had to create a const var and getById to change the header and footer IDs.

## :pushpin: Unable to achieve

- [ ] I didn't look at adding background music as proper websites don't have music playing automatically(!) Something to look at in the future is embedding video playing. :unamused:
- [ ] Had some trouble with using a relative div containing an image with **position: absolute** text inside it. Having several of these over-rode my top nav bar. I had to fix this with z-index. This then stopping the **position: sticky** header from scrolling to the top and replacing 'Resilience' with added text. Sad times. :persevere:

## :computer: External sources I used

W3School - https://www.w3schools.com/  
unsplash.com for royalty-free images  
fonts.google.com for fonts  
https://fontawesome.com/v4/icons for icons  
I have (on occasion) asked GitHubCo-Pilot to explain why something is not working. I look at its suggested code, then reject it and re-write myself. That way, I learn for next time :muscle:
