## :dart: Requirements achieved

- [x] Used semantic tags: header, nav and footer
- [x] Implemented CSS absolute positioning to overlay text on an image - using repeated CSS to reduce code
- [x] Utilised Flexbox to create a responsive layout. I am particularly impressed with using font vw to make text size reponsive to the viewport window
- [x] I am so pleased that I learned how to copy files from my Windows system into the Ubuntu - I had been searching the web for a whole day! Images are cp'ed into the project folder and pushed to github, so are stable for the site. Images are also responsive.

## :dart: Stretch goals

- [x] Back to top button is a Font-Awesome icon using an anchor tag at the top of the page
- [x] I learned how to implement smooth scrolling using CSS scroll-behavior: smooth
- [x] I love using pseudo tags to change the a:hover effects, I used a minimal style to suit this website
- [x] For the footer social media icons, I used the Font-Awesome icons.

- [ ] I didn't look at adding background music as proper websites don't have music playing automatically. Something to look at in the future is embedding video playing.
- [ ] Had some trouble with using a relative div containing an image with position: absolute text inside it. Having several of these over-rode my top nav bar. I had to fix this with z-index. This then stopping the position:sticky header from scrolling to the top and replacing 'Resilience' with added text. Sad times.
